# FizzBuzz
Write a short JavaSx program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line and for each multiple of 3, prints "Fizz" instead of the number while each multiple of 5, prints "Buzz" instead of the number.   For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
